# Trenz TE0706-03 Zynq carrier board chassis

A chassis for the [Trenz TE0706-03](https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/TE0706-03-TE0706-Carrierboard-for-Trenz-Electronic-Modules-with-4-x-5-cm-Form-Factor) carrier board without the optional DIN 41612 port installed. We use it for development on [Hastlayer](https://hastlayer.com) for the upcoming [Xilinx Zynq-7000](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-7000.html) support.

## Printing:

Used Cura's default settings for my Anycubic I3 Mega. Needs support for the port holes.

The top is a flat rectangle with a hole for the hinge, you can use any sheet material and the bottom as a template. I've used some leftover acrylic sheet.
